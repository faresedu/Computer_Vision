# Advance Computer Vision with Python Course Study

This repository documents my study journey through the "Advance Computer Vision with Python" course. The course covers various topics in computer vision, including hand tracking, pose estimation, face detection, and face mesh.

## Course Overview

The "Advance Computer Vision with Python" course provides a comprehensive exploration of advanced computer vision techniques using Python. The following topics are covered in-depth:

1. **Hand Tracking:**
   - Understanding and implementing hand tracking algorithms.
   - Detecting and tracking the movement of hands in images or video frames.
   - Utilizing hand landmarks for interaction and gesture recognition.

2. **Pose Estimation:**
   - Learning techniques for estimating the pose of objects or humans in images.
   - Implementing pose estimation algorithms to capture body positions and orientations.
   - Applying pose estimation in real-world scenarios.

3. **Face Detection:**
   - Exploring face detection algorithms and methodologies.
   - Detecting faces in images or video streams.
   - Understanding the applications of face detection in security, surveillance, and more.

4. **Face Mesh:**
   - Investigating face mesh algorithms for detailed facial feature extraction.
   - Creating 3D facial models using face mesh techniques.
   - Understanding the importance of face mesh in augmented reality and virtual reality applications.
